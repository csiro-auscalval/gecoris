Introduction

Geodetic Corner Reflector (In)SAR Toolbox (GECORIS) is a Python framework for integrated analysis of satellite SAR time series of natural and artificial radar reflectors, such as corner reflectors or radar transponders. 
GECORIS can:

- perform geodetic positioning of artificial reflectors;
- assess the clutter level of a particular site before reflector installation;
- estimate the Radar Cross Section (RCS) time series to track reflectorâ€™s performance and detect outliers, e.g. due to debris accumulation or damage;
- estimate the Signal-to-Clutter Ratio (SCR) to predict the positioning precision and the InSAR phase variance;
- estimate the InSAR displacement time series of the reflector network.

GECORIS is partly built on the `Sentinels Application Platform (SNAP) <https://github.com/senbox-org/>`_. Currently supported are Sentinel-1 SLC measurements. 

GECORIS is described in this `paper <https://doi.org/10.3390/rs13050926>`_.
