# GECORIS
Geodetic Corner Reflector (In)SAR Toolbox - a Python framework for analyzing satellite SAR time series of artificial radar reflectors, such as corner reflectors or radar transponders. 
GECORIS can:

* perform geodetic positioning of artificial reflectors;
* assess the clutter level of a particular site before reflector installation;
* estimate the Radar Cross Section (RCS) time series to track reflectorâ€™s performance and detect outliers, e.g. due to debris accumulation or damage;
* estimate the Signal-to-Clutter Ratio (SCR) to predict the positioning precision and the InSAR phase variance;
* estimate the InSAR displacement time series of the reflector network.

GECORIS is partly built on the [Sentinels Application Platform (SNAP)](https://github.com/senbox-org/). Currently supported are Sentinel-1 SLC measurements. 

GECORIS is described in this [paper](https://doi.org/10.3390/rs13050926).
